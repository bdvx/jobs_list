# jobs_list
# Note: this is still a work in progress
A small project which helps aggregate and filter jobs from different destinations

Now this app is using API from:
* Github Jobs (https://jobs.github.com/api)
* HeadHunter (https://dev.hh.ru/)
* LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)

The API part is an Express server which updates our jobs ever our on cron(by using setInterval method )
